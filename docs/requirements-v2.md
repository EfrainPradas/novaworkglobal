## Executive Summary

**CareerTipsAI** (CTAI) is an **autonomous AI career agent platform** powered by the proprietary **CTAI Master Framework™ 2.0**. Unlike career tools that require constant user interaction, CTAI introduces **"My Career Agent™"** - an intelligent companion that thinks, plans, executes, adapts, tracks, and improves autonomously while the user focuses on their life.

### Transformational Value Proposition

**The Old Way:**
- Users manually search job boards daily
- Spend hours customizing resumes per job
- Write cover letters from scratch
- Track applications in spreadsheets
- Prepare for interviews alone
- Feel lost and overwhelmed

**The CTAI Way:**
- **Agent scans jobs daily** (automatic)
- **Agent customizes resumes per job** (automatic)
- **Agent drafts cover letters** (automatic)
- **Agent tracks everything** in smart dashboard
- **Agent prepares interview materials** (automatic)
- **Agent provides clarity, confidence, direction** (guided)

**Result:** **75% faster time-to-interview** with less stress and more confidence

### Core Innovation: Autonomous Job Search Intelligence™

**Industry First:** No other platform offers **fully automated, done-for-you job search**. Every competitor requires manual effort:
- LinkedIn: User must search and apply
- Indeed: User must search and apply
- ZipRecruiter: User must search and apply
- TopResume: Helps with resume, but user still searches

**CTAI:** Agent does the searching, matching, customizing, and applying **FOR YOU**.

### Development Strategy: Tools-First → Agent Evolution

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-12):** Build foundational **tools** that deliver value:
- Clarity diagnostic
- Resume analyzer
- Interview prep
- Job tracker
- Learning paths

**Phase 2 (Weeks 13-24):** Add **agent intelligence layer**:
- Background job scanning
- Automated resume tailoring
- Weekly cycle automation
- Intelligent recommendations

**Phase 3 (Weeks 25-32):** Achieve **full autonomy**:
- Multi-job applications per day
- Autonomous interview prep
- Predictive career insights
- Emotional intelligence

**Rationale:** Users need to **trust the tools** before trusting the agent to act autonomously. Progressive automation builds confidence.

    jobs = [j for j in jobs if j.match_score >= 70]

    # Save to database
    save_job_matches(user_profile.user_id, jobs)

    # Notify user
    send_email("Your agent found {count} jobs", jobs[:10])
```

**B. Match Scoring Algorithm**
```python
def calculate_match_score(user_profile, job):
    score = 0
    weights = {}

    # Skills match (40% weight)
    user_skills = set(user_profile.skills)
    required_skills = extract_skills_from_job(job.description)
    skills_overlap = len(user_skills & required_skills) / len(required_skills)
    score += skills_overlap * 40

    # Experience level match (20% weight)
    years_match = compare_experience(user_profile.years_exp, job.required_years)
    score += years_match * 20

    # Title similarity (15% weight)
    title_sim = calculate_title_similarity(user_profile.target_roles, job.title)
    score += title_sim * 15

    # Location match (10% weight)
    if job.remote or job.location == user_profile.location:
        score += 10

    # Salary match (10% weight)
    if job.salary_min >= user_profile.salary_min:
        score += 10

    # Company size preference (5% weight)
    if job.company_size in user_profile.preferred_company_sizes:
        score += 5

    return min(int(score), 100)
```

**C. Resume Tailoring**
```python
def tailor_resume(user_resume, job):
    prompt = f"""
    You are an expert resume writer. Tailor this resume for the job below.

    ORIGINAL RESUME:
    {user_resume.content}

    Return the tailored resume in the same format.

    tailored = call_openai(prompt, model="gpt-4o")

        content=tailored,
        version_type="job_tailored"
    )

    return tailored
```

**D. Cover Letter Generation**
```python
def generate_cover_letter(user_profile, job):
    # Research company
    company_info = research_company(job.company)  # Could use GPT + web search

    prompt = f"""

    COMPANY INFO:

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Professional tone, enthusiastic but not desperate

    Return only the cover letter body (no header/footer).

- **Intelligent throttling** (apply to X jobs per week, user-configurable)
- **Quality control** (agent only applies to 80+ match score jobs)
